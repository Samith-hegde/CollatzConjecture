Question 3.21

In the written program (in the file main.c), the child process will output the sequence of numbers obtained from the algorithm as specified under the conditions of the Collatz conjecture.
Here, the parent and child processes havev their own copies of the data.

When the program performs fork(), it enters into an if loop: if pid==1 (i.e., if it is busy), then it waits till it equals 0 (not busy).
When it becomes 0, it is ready to perform the necessary calculations.
It checks to see if the number is even or odd and performs the calculation as specified by the appropriate formula. This keeps repeating until the sequence reaches 1, upon which it breaks out of the loop.
